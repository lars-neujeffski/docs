# Home

Let us guide you through the knowledge landscape for Shopware 6. This documentation is organized to provide knowledge for different **products**, **topics** and **areas** of interest.

The two main sections, **Concepts** and **Guides**, help you navigate the documentation according to your needs.

While **Concepts** convey the ideas, inner workings, and architectural considerations behind our product, **Guides** provide explicit examples, step-by-step tutorials that address specific tasks.

These two sections are complemented by the **References**, which contain structured code references, lists of flags, commands, and endpoints useful for development.

Visit the [Academy](https://academy.shopware.com/collections?category=developer-sw6) for video content. If you still have questions, you can always ask them on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=shopware) or join our awesome community on [Slack](https://slack.shopware.com). /).
